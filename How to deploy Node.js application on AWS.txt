Install NodeJS and NPM using nvm

Install node version manager (nvm) by typing the following at the command line.

curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash

Activate nvm by typing the following at the command line.

Test that node and npm are installed and running correctly by typing the following at the terminal:

node -v

npm -v

Install Git and clone repository from GitHub for node app

To install git, run below commands in the terminal window:

sudo yum update -y

sudo yum install git -y

Just to verify if system has git installed or not, please run below command in terminal:

git â€” version

This command will print the git version in the terminal.
Run below command to clone the code repository from Github:

git clone https://github.com/sumant-mishra/node-app.git

This will create a folder with name node-app.


Install dependencies

Now, move to the folder node-app by running below command in the terminal window:

cd node-app

If you check the list of folders using ls command, the current folder structure does not contain the node_modules folder. This folder will be created automatically after installing the dependencies. To install dependencies, run below command in the terminal:
npm install

Start the application
To start the application, run the below command in the terminal:
node index.js

If the server runs successfully, then it should print a message with the port number in the terminal window then we will need to configure the Security group and add
inbound rule 3100.
